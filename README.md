### Credits
1. Thanks to the Udacity staff for training me to use this data (and for wrangling it beforehand to allow me to ficus on the first steps.). :sparkles
2. Also thanks to the Udacity crew for the code examples and template to help me learn and think at the same time.
3. Thanks to Anthony F., a classmate that posted lots of questions and answers and showed me how to approach the solution for pairing Start and End stations.
4. Thanks to lots of discussions on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com)
5. TO DO: Might be nice to allow users more control over filters and lines.
